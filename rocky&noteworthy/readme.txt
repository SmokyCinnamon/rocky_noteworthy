--Rocky & Noteworthy--

Made with Zarla's ghost template http://www.ashido.com / http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html
Rocky (and the old man river poem) belong to Tracy
For those of you who are lackadaisy fans, I've added in the old man river poem -- both versions, actually. for those of you who are not, or just don't remember it and want to see it in it's actual context where tracy originally wrote it, go here: https://www.lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=14
(I didn't write any of it)


Thanks for downloading these two!
A slight warning, first: Rocky has some possibly disturbing poses. And also doesn't blink, like, at all. So... if you don't want to be stared at, this is likely not the ghost for you,
(Sorry.)

Right-click on either Rocky or Noteworthy to bring up their respective menus, double-click for their respective personal menus
You can pet them by moving your mouse over their heads, and hit rocky / pat noteworthy by double-clicking on their heads.

Hotkeys:
t = make them talk
r = repeat what they just said
ctrl = ...I think this makes them speed through dialogue? Or just skip to the end of it. I've only accidentally used this while saving things and such, haha
